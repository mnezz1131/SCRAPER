SCRAPER HOMEWORK
The assignment was to make a "newscraper" based on a homework assignment and referenced in the Mongo News Scraper link.  I searched a couple of news source for a good scraping platform and all the news is so goddamn depressing I just couldn't do it.  So I went to back to my default of music. However the music sites I get new from didn't have all that much music news so I went to guitars. Scraping the news on Guitar World and the Lessons was more or less the same process so I went with the lessons as something I would actually use after this class.  It made the assignment much more enjoyable for me also.  It's no where near where I want it to be, but alas I am out of time and cannot afford to fall behind on the upcoming assigments trying to perfect this.
